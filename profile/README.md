### RUGFACTORY
where tokens have short lifespans


👋 hello
<br/>
this project is currently a work in progress
<br/>
my goal: to create easier solutions for ruggers on near.
<br/>
my progress: currently i have forked some near examples because that is a great place to get started.
thought i did a great job of optimizing the size of the token factory contract, but then discovered that it didn't work.
<br/>
next steps: to continue learning, and to build custom contracts that are smaller.


Also along the way I hope to fully document everything. I have added documentation to the factory contract, and...
<br/>
I promise one day a solution so you don't have to create tokens form the cli.
